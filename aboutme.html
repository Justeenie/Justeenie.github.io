                    <p>Hello, I am Justin Lim (the one on the right) and I am currently enrolled in the Mechatronics and Robotics course in the school of Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering (DMRO/FT/2A/02). I enjoy woodwork along with arts and crafts (drawing, painting ,origami and many more! It all depends on what inspires me).</p>
                    <p>I chose Digital Fabrication as my elective as I felt that it was very similar to the course I currently take, and it would give me the opportunity to apply the skills I have learnt to create something. At the time of writing this, I have no idea what i might create, it could be anything from a practical contraption that would help me automate a simple task, or it could be a purely decorative feauture meant to provide some entertainment. </p>
                    <h3>This website will show you everything that i have done throughout this module and the navigation bar at the top of this webpage will get you to anywhere you want!</h3>
