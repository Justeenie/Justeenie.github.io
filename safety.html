				<h1>Fablab Safety</h1>
				<p>
					Safety is often regarded as a very repetative and boring topic but in the Fablab safety is
					incredibly important. There are many machines and tools that can easily cause massive injuries if
					not used correctly such as power tools, CNC machines, hot air gun and many others. The very first
					requirement to be allowed in the Fablab is proper attire. Below shows the general attire guidelines
					for male and female students.

							These symbols help to inform the users of the possible hazards and dangers of using the tool
							or machinery it is attached to. There are also the symbols in blue that would inform the
							user of the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (also known as PPE for short) to wear
							while using the tool/machine.

				<h3>To sum everything up, safety in the Fablab is extremely important as there are many tools/machines
					that could easily leave massive permanent injuries. It is always best to ASK how to use any given
					tool or machine if a student was ever unsure. It is ALWAYS better to clarify and be safe than sorry.
