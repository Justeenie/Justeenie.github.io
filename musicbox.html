                <h2>Laser Cutting and its applications</h2>

                <p>
                    Laser Cutting is a very efficient and effective way of cutting many pieces of a material such as
                    acrylic, wood
                    paper and many more. With its highly accurate cutting and impressive speed, its only real downside
                    is that it
                    can only cut 2D flat objects. This is not a huge limitation considering the fact that a 3D model
                    such as a
                    box, could easily be divided into 6 flat sides with tabs (small extrusions on each side) to later
                    assemble.

                <h2>How to laser cut</h2>
                <p>
                    Laser cutting is actually pretty simple. Just have a 2D sketch ready (it could be a 2D view of a
                    flat 3D model piece)
                    and export it to CorelDraw and position the pieces together closely on one area of the canvas (in
                    this case, it would
                    be the area of the plywood/acrylic). I was taught to always keep the pieces tightly fitted and close
                    to one another on
                    the canvas in order to furthur maximize the amount of useful area for future cuts. The
                    <b>colours</b> of the lines on
                    CorelDraw matter, red for cutting and green for engraving. Last but not least, the lines should all
                    have 'hairline'
                    thickness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moving on, all that's left is to select the "jog" option and use the joystick to move the laser
                    cutter to the starting
                    position at the top-left corner of the board. The red button that looks similar to a star enables a
                    laser pointer to
                    help with the positioning of the starting point.

                <h2>My laser cutting assignment </h2>

                <p>
                    For my assignment, I was given the task to make a music box that has a movable lid with at least one
                    engraving
                    on it as a decoration. I decided to take it one step further and come up with a design slightly more
                    unique! Since
                    its a music box, I decided to make the box in a shape of a piano and engrave the keys of the piano
                    as decoration.
                    Below I will show you the process of how I designed my Music Box.

                <h2>Using Fusion360 for 3D Modeling</h2>

                <p>
                    Before diving into the design of the music box, I needed to make the design parametric. It is simply
                    defining parameters
                    using variables and then proceeding to dimension the model using these variables, in that way, if I
                    wanted to change the
                    dimensions of the box I could easily change a single variable. One such situation where I had to
                    utilize this was when I
                    modelled using the thickness '3mm' but later had to change the thickness to '3.9mm' as that was the
                    thickness of the plywood
                    provided to me.

                    To laser cut flat, 2D pieces of wood and later assemble it into a 3D box, the simple approach would
                    be divide the box
                    into 6 flat sides (assuming its a 6 sided box), then later assemble it and glue it together. One
                    issue is that the
                    contact surface area for gluing the sides together maybe too small, therefore to deal with this I
                    was taught to make
                    tabs on the sides of the box that connects with other sides to interlock the sides.

                <p>
                    For the sides of the box I need to make a 'hinge' that I could attatch the lid to and allow it to
                    rotate for my lid
                    to open and close. And to my suprise later on, the laser cut circles were basically perfect! I
                    needed 2 of these,
                    one for each side of the box so I utilized the mirrror feature to repeat this on the other side of
                    the box.

                <p>
                    Personally, the lid was the most challenging part to design. Just a flat lid with one extrusion on
                    each side to attatch
                    the lid to the hinge could not possibly be that challenging right? That's absolutely correct! It was
                    only challenging
                    for me due to me being paranoid of the small hinge snapping or the hinge getting loose after a
                    period of time so I wanted
                    to avoid literally fitting a square peg into a round hole. Instead I decided to design an extrusion
                    slightly larger than the
                    hinge and later on manually file it down to a circular shape.

                <p>
                    The rest of the model are basically the repeat of above to make the stair like shape of my music
                    box. I attatched
                    all the sides at the top to the lid so that i could later fit the music crank inside without
                    obstructions.

                    Now, all that was left was to export it CorelDraw where I can now add engravings onto it as
                    decoration
                    and start the laser cutting process. Exporting is simply done by selecting the sketch of a body, and
                    exporting
                    it as a DXF file, this gives a 2D sketch which is dimensioned and would allow it to be imported to
                    CorelDraw and
                    cut by the machine.

                <p>engravings are easily added by taking a picture and pasting it onto the canvas. The machine is able
                    to engrave black and white images very clearly but even if the image is coloured, the machine will
                    just use varying amounts of power and frequency to at least give it a differing shade. In my case, I
                    chose to engrave some piano keys as well as some other decorations.
