                <h2>3D printing and it's applications</h2>

                <p>3D printing is a relatively recent development in technology where an object can be modeled on a
                    computer software
                    and the digital file could then be translated into printing instructions in order to construct the
                    model. The model
                    is contructed by dividing the object into many smaller 'slices' where the machine will melt a
                    material down (such as
                    PLA, ABS, ASA and many more), then deposit the material layer by layer to eventually construct the
                    entire 3D model.
                    Each layer can be given a specified height to vary the resolution of the print, and the speed of the
                    print. Typically,
                    the layer height could be adjusted to anywhere between 0.1mm to 0.3mm (this depends on the printer
                    and nozzle diameter).

                <p>
                    The process of 3D printing can be simplified to 3 steps.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Firstly, a 3D model must be designed using a modeling software such as Solidworks, TinkerCAD,
                        Autodesk Inventor. In this module, I was taught how to use Fusion360 to design a 3D model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second step is to prepare the model for printing such as adding supports to the model,
                        adjusting the
                        printer's settings and slicing the model into many layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last step is to simply save the file into a memory device such as an SD card or a USB thumb
                        drive in order
                        to transfer the file to the printer.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For this module, we were given the assignment to create a 3D model of a Horse Chess Piece on Fusion
                    360, prepare the
                    model for printing using CURA, and then print it out using the Ultimaker 2 printer in the FabLab.

                <p>Below, I will show you how I have designed and printed the Horse Chess Piece!</p>



                <h2>Designing the Horse Chess Piece in Fusion 360</h2>

                <div class="step1">
                    <p>
                        A horse chess piece has an irregular and odd shape (many curves and arcs) which is hard to
                        replicate using just
                        geometrical shapes. Instead, I borrowed an image of a horse chess piece to use as a guideline,
                        known as a
                        canvas in Fusion 360. It is very similar to using tracing paper on top of a picture as a guide.
                        Firstly,
                        I started by designing the base of the chess piece by using lines and arc to trace out half of
                        the base's
                        vertical cross section.
                    </p>
                    <img src="canvas.png" class="canvas">
                </div>

                <div class="step2">
                    <p>
                        There are some restrictions when it comes
                        to 3D printing and these restrictions must be considered while designing the object. One such
                        restriction
                        is that objects cannot overhang more than 45ᵒ or they would require supports. As seen on the
                        right, I had one arc
                        that <b>exceeds 45ᵒ</b>, and I had to change that angle if I wanted the object to be printed
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <img src="overhang.png" class="overhang">
                    <img src="overhangerror.png" class="overhangerror">
                </div>
                <div class="step2b">
                    <p>
                        I changed the angle of the arcs, although the current shape of the base slightly differs from
                        the original, I have
                        ensured that the height and diameter is the same.The next step is to take this cross section and
                        <b>revolve</b> it.
                        To revolve a sketch, it requires an axis, therefore I have added one (indicated by the vertical
                        dotted line).
                    </p>
                    <img src="horsebasesketch.png" class="horsebasesketch"> <img src="horsebase.png" class="horsebase">
                </div>

                <div class="step3">
                    <p>
                        Moving on, I repeated the process of tracing the canvas for the horse. Some features such as the
                        mouth of the
                        horse were harder to trace due to the arcs being very irregular, however taking some time to
                        change the curvature and
                        angles of the arcs eventually made the shape satisfactory. Then, I <b>extruded</b> the sketch. I
                        left out the ears
                        as I wanted to try something more interesting for them.
                    </p>
                    <img src="horsesketch.png" class="horsesketch"> <img src="horseextrude.png" class="horseextrude">
                </div>

                <div class="step4">
                    <p>
                        At this point, I decided to add in the eyes of the horse using a few arcs to make the eyes a little more 
                        pointed (personal preference) and used the <b>extrude</b> function to cut the eyes into the piece.
                        I will admit I got a little carried away with the ears but basically I started by creating a
                        plane which is angled to the
                        the top of the horse. Following that I used the <b>Loft function</b> to creat a solid body so
                        that I could 'carve out' the ears
                        later on.
                    </p>

                <div class="step5">
                    <p>
                        Thereafter, I made various shapes to cut out portions of the solid block above the horse to make
                        the ears. I only needed
                        to make one ear as I could then <b>mirror</b> the completed ear onto the other side of the
                        horse.
                    </p>

                <div class="step6">
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, I <b>filleted</b> many edges of the horse chess to round the corners. This
                        makes the piece both more
                        aesthetically pleasing and prevent the piece from chipping easily.

                        There are many settings that can be changed using CURA for any given printer, but only a few key
                        settings
                        that are very important and are relavent to this horse chess piece. After changing the settings
                        to
                        suit this
                        particular print, all I needed to do was to slice the model and export it to an SD card to start
                        the
                        print.
                        To start off, I ensured that the printer <b>Ultimaker 2+</b> was selected and then imported my
                        3D
                        model from

                                that I do not deny others from using the 3D printers in the FabLab)
