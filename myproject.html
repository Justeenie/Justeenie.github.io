                <h1>My Project: Coin Sorter V1</h1>
                <p>For my final project in this module, I created did a group project with two of my classmates, Guo
                    Liang and Ethan Ng. We decided to make a automatic coin sorter that will both sort and count coins.
                    The limits of our project (at least for this version of the coin sorter) are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>can only sort the latest generation of coins (3rd gen Singapore coins)</li>
                    <li>requires the user to input coins one at a time into a slot (eventually we planned to make it a
                        pouch/ funnel where the user could pour all their coins in at once)</li>
                    <li>maximum sorting speed of roughly 2 coins per second</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With these limitations in mind, we proceeded to design and model the 3d physical components</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall casing</li>
                    <li>Dividers of each type of coin ($1, $0.50, $0.20, $0.10 $0.05)</li>
                    <li>Individual boxes to store the coins</li>
                    <li>Coin sorting board (a slanted board with holes with increasing sizes for the coins to roll down
                        and fall through)</li>
                    <li>Pouch and Wheel (for the user to dump their coins in, followed by the wheel taking out only one
                        coin at a time to put on the sorting board)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And also here are the list of electrical components of our Coin Sorter V1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arduino Uno board, the "computer" and "brain" of our sorting system</li>
                    <li>Infared Sensors to count the amount of each coin detected</li>
                    <li>Stepper motor to rotate the wheel</li>
                    <li>LCD screen to display all the information such as amount of each type of coin counted</li>
                    <li>Buttons to get around the menu to view information about the sorter and to control the machine
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Of course, we divided the work between ourselves to ensure everyone has at least one laser cutting
                    component, one electrical component (embedded micro-controller that is connected to the arduino uno
                    board and one 3D printed component. For me, the components that I have worked on is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Laser Cutting: Dividers of each type of coin AND Individual boxes to store the coins</li>
                    <li>3D Printing: Coin sorting board</li>
                    <li>Embedded microcontroller: Infared-Sensors (IR sensors) connected to the Arduino Uno board</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                <p>I had two different laser cutting components, the first of which is to make the dividers. I use the
                    used Fusion360 to model the dividers with tabs to connect them easily later on</p>
