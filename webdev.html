                <h1>Website Development</h1>
                <p>
                    Website development seemed like a very daughting task at the start, where my lecturer Mr Steven Chew
                    told us to watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk&ab_channel=JakeWright">
                        video by Jake Wright</a> as a start to learning the basics of website design. There are three
                    basic "parts" of a website, a <b>.html</b> (HyperText Markup Language) which is the basic formatting
                    and text of the webpage, a <b>.css</b> (cascading style sheet) which further helps with formatting,
                    adding features, as well as make the webpage much more beautiful by adding backgrounds, pictures and
                    more, last but
                    not least there is a <b>.js</b> (javascript) which helps with more complex functions and features
                    such as doing simple animations on a webpage. JavaScript is a programming language and is very
                    versatile in its applications. However, I chose not to utilise JavaScript for this website as I did
                    not find that it added much to my website and instead, concentrated on using css to make my webpage
                    look neater.

                        <p>
                            Throughout this module, I felt that the best method for me to learn web design was to just
                            get started with the website and use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> to
                            help me whenever I hit a wall. In programming and coding, Google is my best friend and
                            almost all issues I ran into could be solved as long as I took the time to look it up and
                            learn.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Below, I will show you how I made some specific features I have added onto my website such
                            as a navigation bar, clickable pictures that links onto different webpages and share a
                            little on how I formatted my website.</h3>

                <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>

                <div class="grid2">
                    <div class="grid2a">
                        <p>
                            The Navigation Bar is the bar that you can see at the top of your screen no matter which
                            page you are on on my website and regardless of where you scroll. I learnt how to do this
                            with some help from the <a
                                href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown_navbar.asp">W3Schools</a>
                            website
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid2b">
                        <h3>Navigation Bar code in html</h3>
                        <img src="navhtml.png" class="imgstd">
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid2c">
                        <h3>Navigation Bar code in css</h3>
                        <img src="navcss.png" class="imgstd">
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid2d">
                        <p>The navigation bar code in html basically decides the display of each "button" on the
                            navigation bar the different <b>divisions</b> I added helps me to format the bar later on.
                            The <b>href</b> essentially makes the text a hyperlink that in effect, will allow you to
                            navigate to other pages on click.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the css code for the nav bar, I made the <b>position: fixed</b> to enable the navigation
                            bar to stay at the top of the screen regardless of where the user scrolls. I do this as I
                            find that it helps the user navigate easily without needing to scroll to the top of the
                            webpage to access other pages of the website.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <h2>Clickable Pictures</h2>

                <p>
                    Clickable Pictures are not the same as the aforementioned <b>href</b> hyperlinks for the
                    Navigation Bar. Instead, I ensured that the picture I has its own <b>division</b> and added an
                    adress for the user to be redirected to onclick. I added a style (which could easily be done in
                    the css code too) which changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering above the image to
                    indicate to the user that the image is clickable.
                </p>

                <h2>Formatting</h2>
                <p>
                    Formatting of pictures and bodies of text was very challenging for me at first, but I eventually ran
                    into a very useful css feature I could use to arrange everything exactly how I want it to be. It is
                    a combination of placing all content into separate <b>divisions</b> and use <b>grid-areas</b> in css
                    to place the divisions into different areas of a grid that I could customize to any way I like.
                </p>
                <grid class="grid3">
                    <div class="grid3a">
                        <img src="gridhtml.png" class="imgstd">
                        <h3>Grid Areas code for html</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid3b">
                        <img src="gridcss.png" class="imgstd">
                        <h3>Grid Areas code for css</h3>
                    </div>
                </grid>

                <p>
                    I took this example directly from above to illustrate how it coding grid areas would look like. This
                    is honestly my favourite way of formatting, although it is not extremely effiecient or elegant, it
                    is definitely a very easy way of formatting my text and images together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, website development is not very complex but there are many features that one can learn
                    and add to their website. I enjoyed my time learning web design in this module and find it quite a
                    practical skill.
